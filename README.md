## 🚀 About This Repository
Welcome to my code lab. This repository documents my progression from **Core Java fundamentals** toward enterprise-level **Full-Stack Development**. 

As someone passionate about both **Logic (Backend)** and **Design (UI/UX)**, I focus on writing clean, readable, and structured code.

## 🛠️ Concepts Mastered (So Far)
*A snapshot of my current technical arsenal as I build my foundation.*

### 🔹 Core Java Syntax
* **Control Flow:** Mastering logic with `if-else`, `switch`, and ternary operators.
* **Iterative Logic:** efficient use of `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
* **Input/Output:** User interaction via `java.util.Scanner` and formatted printing (`printf`).

### 🔹 Logic Building
* Mathematical algorithms (Unit digits, Number systems).
* Pattern generation and iterative problem solving.

### 🔹 Version Control
* **Git & GitHub:** Commits, Pushes, and Repository management.
